MJ's Whack-a-mole game
===

This code is a fully functional browser-based whack-a-mole game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

All graphics were created by me in GIMP 2.8.6.

This was designed for Google Chrome, on a monitor with 1920x1080 resolution, but can be played on a monitor with a resolution as low as 1024x768.

The game has been tested in Chrome 32.0.1700.76 m, Firefox 26.0, and Internet Explorer 11, on both resolutions stated above.
